In particular, a RESTful HTTP API that allows you to interact with M 3 G purely as data that can be uploaded, accessed, searched for, etc. via HTTP requests . HTTP basically allows you to GET , POST , PUT , DELETE etc. resources on a remote server. These resources are identified via URLs (=uniform resource locator). URLs usually consists of a protocol (e.g. HTTP), a domain (our servers), a path (a place on our servers), and query parameters (additional options). M 3 G API: available operations At present, M 3 G API provides 5 main \"groups\" of operations: Network License Metadata , Product and Update (i.e. to get info, export or update some sections of station site logs in M 3 G, respectively) Within most of these resource \"groups\", you find endpoints that either allow you to retrieve info on a given M 3 G entry (i.e. a network, a station) or to ask a query to locate many M 3 G entries at the same time (see the M 3 G Swagger user interface ). M 3 G API: tools One can start to test M 3 G API thanks to different tools and libraries. For example, one could use: an HTTP program like curl to directly use M 3 G API from within a shell a generic Python HTTP library such as requests the browser, via the M 3 G Swagger UI , based on an OpenAPI spec , describing some of M 3 G function calls In the following sections, you'll find some examples for common M 3 G tasks using various tools/options.","title":"Short intro to M3G API"},{"location":"intro/#short-intro-to-m3g-api","text":"M 3 G offers some of its functionalities through an application programming interface (API).

To do this, one needs to get authorization via the \"Application access token\" : import requests headers = { 'accept' : 'application/json' , 'Authorization' : 'Bearer xxx..' } # where 'xxx..' is your \"Application access token\" # authorization is not needed for GET requests: #headers={'accept': 'application/json'} Examples of some basic functions to interact M 3 G API via requests As mentioned in the example with curl , to perform this specific task, the M 3 G API requires the id aka the station 9-characters id and the records that will be changed as key/values pairs: the name of the person who is allowed to change the site log ( updateMadeBy ), the new firmware version ( changedTo ) and the date. One could write a couple of functions on the fly using the requests module we have just loaded: #store the M3G API URL: def url ( path ): return 'https://gnss-metadata.eu/v1/' + path #get info about a site log giventhe 9-char id: def get_sitelog ( station_id ): return requests . get ( url ( 'sitelog/view?id= {} ' . format ( station_id )), headers = headers ) #update a record in the site log (the firmware version in this case) given the 9-char id: def update_firmware ( station_id , updateMadeBy , changedTo , datetimeISO , datetimeISOfuture ): url = url ( 'sitelog/firmware-change?id= {} ' . format ( station_id )) return requests . put ( url , json = { 'updateMadeBy' : updateMadeBy , 'changedTo' : changedTo , 'endOfTheLastSection' : datetimeISO , 'startOfTheNewSection' : datetimeISOfuture , }, headers = headers ) Update the sitelog with a new firmware We then send the request to update the site log with the mandatory information: my_update = update_firmware ( 'BRUX00BEL' , 'Carine Bruyninx' , '5.3.1' , '2020-09-04T11:50Z' , '2020-09-04T11:51Z' ) my_update . status_code The latter will return as a response one of HTTP status codes, as we mentioned before: 200 Retrieve the sitelog We can now check if the record now stored in M 3 G is what we expect.

Let's look at the test example mentioned above, on how to update/change the firmware section of a station. To do this, one needs to get authorization via the \"Application access token\" : import requests headers = { 'accept' : 'application/json' , 'Authorization' : 'Bearer xxx..' } # where 'xxx..' is your \"Application access token\" # authorization is not needed for GET requests: #headers={'accept': 'application/json'}","title":"Use python requests library"},{"location":"python/#examples-of-some-basic-functions-to-interact-m3g-api-via-requests","text":"As mentioned in the example with curl , to perform this specific task, the M 3 G API requires the id aka the station 9-characters id and the records that will be changed as key/values pairs: the name of the person who is allowed to change the site log ( updateMadeBy ), the new firmware version ( changedTo ) and the date. One could write a couple of functions on the fly using the requests module we have just loaded: #store the M3G API URL: def url ( path ): return 'https://gnss-metadata.eu/v1/' + path #get info about a site log giventhe 9-char id: def get_sitelog ( station_id ): return requests . get ( url ( 'sitelog/view?id= {} ' . format ( station_id )), headers = headers ) #update a record in the site log (the firmware version in this case) given the 9-char id: def update_firmware ( station_id , updateMadeBy , changedTo , datetimeISO , datetimeISOfuture ): url = url ( 'sitelog/firmware-change?id= {} ' . format ( station_id )) return requests . put ( url , json = { 'updateMadeBy' : updateMadeBy , 'changedTo' : changedTo , 'endOfTheLastSection' : datetimeISO , 'startOfTheNewSection' : datetimeISOfuture , }, headers = headers )","title":"Examples of some basic functions to interact M3G API via requests"},{"location":"python/#update-the-sitelog-with-a-new-firmware","text":"We then send the request to update the site log with the mandatory information: my_update = update_firmware ( 'BRUX00BEL' , 'Carine Bruyninx' , '5.3.1' , '2020-09-04T11:50Z' , '2020-09-04T11:51Z' ) my_update . status_code The latter will return as a response one of HTTP status codes, as we mentioned before: 200","title":"Update the sitelog with a new firmware"},{"location":"python/#retrieve-the-sitelog","text":"We can now check if the record now stored in M 3 G is what we expect.
